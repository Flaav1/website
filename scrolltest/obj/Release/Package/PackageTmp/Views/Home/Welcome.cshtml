    <h2>Safely Sell and Buy used underwear.</h2>

    <h4 >
        We have created an easy to use portal for people to sell and buy used underwear, <br />
        maintaining a pretty good modercome of privacy. You can choose to contact the seller directly <br />
        or you can buy through our Premium Service where we take care of everything for you.  <br />
        You just sit back and relax while we're doing the <span>dirty</span> work.

    <h2> How does it work </h2>
    <h2 > Buy </h2>
    <h4 >
        You can browse through our products by clicking the Browse button on the navigation bar, <br />
        Once you found the right product you can create an account <span> free of charge</span> and contact the seller directly or let us contact him on your behalf,<br />
        This way you can maintain a <span>100% anonymity</span>. 

    </h4>
    <h2 > Sell </h2>
    <h4 >
        After you've created an account free of charge sellers have to <span>pay a 10€ monthly tax</span> and then you can add as many producs as you like <br />
        Buyers may contact you directly from our website or they can contact you through our own service to maintain 100% anonymity. <br />
        Once the buyer makes the payment we advise you to ship your product in the most discrete way possible.
